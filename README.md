# Email Spam Detection 📧

This project is an **Email Spam Detection** model developed during my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The objective of this project is to classify emails as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Text vectorization (using techniques like CountVectorizer or TF-IDF)
* Model building and training (using classification algorithms)
* Model evaluation and testing

## 📁 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK (or other NLP libraries)
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [(https://github.com/Priyam2xx3/OIBSIP_SPAM)]
   ```


2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Email_Spam_Detection.ipynb
   ```

4. Run all cells to see the complete workflow.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains emails labeled as spam or not spam, along with their text content.
You can download dataset from kaggle or any other sources

## ✅ Results

The model can classify emails with good accuracy and can help filter spam effectively.
